Original Readme from http://code.google.com/p/wsdl2objc/ follows:
=================================================================

This project is a replacement for Apple's WSMakeStubs utility and WS-Core.

9/15/2009 - Version 0.6 release notes:

Fixes for iPhone compatibility
Greatly improved WSDL compatibility
11/11/2008 - Version 0.5 release notes:

iPhone compiling added to the Usage Instructions (see http://code.google.com/p/wsdl2objc/wiki/UsageInstructions )
Generated code will now import Foundation instead of Cocoa
Added an option to add a tag "Svc" to the end of the service name to avoid naming conflicts. Use this if you're seeing "redefinition of struct" errors on compiling
Improved WSDL compatibility (added support for xsd:float type)
10/24/2008 - Version 0.4 release notes:

Improved WSDL compatibility
long, double, int, etc types are now processed with NSNumbers instead of needing to use malloc()/free()

Readme From Eric Berman, the other last living being to use WSDL2Objc:
======================================================================

# WSDLtoObjC
Several years ago, I developed my first iOS app (MyFlightbook), which consumed a SOAP service.  I found WSDLToObjC at its [old home](https://github.com/ericberman/WSDLtoObjC.git).  It was open source (MIT License) but largely abandoned.

I made a few contributions before Google archived their code hosting, at which point I was pretty clearly the only client for it and thus brought the code into my own source tree.  I have made small changes since then, mostly to keep up with Apple's ever growing list of deprecations and other similar changes.

But as I move the MyFlightbook code into the open source world, I am re-introducing WSDLToObjC to the open source community again, under its original MIT license.

Thanks
