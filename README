Fixes for iPhone compatibility
Greatly improved WSDL compatibility

iPhone compiling added to the Usage Instructions (see http://code.google.com/p/wsdl2objc/wiki/UsageInstructions )
Generated code will now import Foundation instead of Cocoa
Added an option to add a tag "Svc" to the end of the service name to avoid naming conflicts. Use this if you're seeing "redefinition of struct" errors on compiling
Improved WSDL compatibility (added support for xsd:float type)

Improved WSDL compatibility
